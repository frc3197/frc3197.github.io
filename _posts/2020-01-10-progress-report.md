The first week of build season is coming to a close. Due to weather related incidents, tomorrow will be a shortened build day, going from 10:00 to 5:00 instead of from 10:00 to 10:00. However, many things are planned for tomorrow and, combined with what we have done in these three days, the coding team is off to a good start

**What we accomplished in these last 3 days**
- Coded Drive Train Framework
- Familiarized with WPILib 2020 Command-Based Framework
- Coded basic autonomous involving a single Command
- Coded autonomous involving a Sequential Command group
  - Reminder: In Command Groups, isFinished() should return true so that the command group can move on to the next command.
- Coded a button that ran an autonomous command
- Coded a button that ran a Sequential Command Groups

**What we are planning to do tomorrow**
- Learn/Implement PID on Drive Train
- Begin working with Limelight
- Code a "chase" protocol and test in autonomous
- Code an Autonomous script that drives forward, turns 90 degrees, then drives forward with smooth turning

By the way, Gradle makes me want to commit sudoku, so let's just abandon the automatic javadoc thing. It's not worth it. Also I need to update the CSS on this website lest it stay looking like it's in the 80s. Okay bye.
