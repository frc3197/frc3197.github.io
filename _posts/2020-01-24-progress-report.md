I've been sick for a while so the posts have been sparse, but I'm back and there's a lot of progress and a lot of problems.

**What we accomplished these past 2 weeks**
- Did Rudimentary Velocity Control
- Did some PID for turning, driving a certain distance, etc.
- Began doing Limelight

**What we are planning to do tomorrow**
- Figure out why the output of the TrackLimelightX PIDCommand is 0. WHY IS IT 0.

Yeah this problem annoys the heck out of me. Also there were a few naming problems and general version management that ended up deleting some old stuff and resulted in 6 different branches. 6 BRANCHES. WHAT HAPPENED.
What did, in fact, happen, is that I wasn't there and organization kind of died. I'll be sure to clean up organization so that things are neater.
