Post one is live. Jekyll is an absolute godsend, not gonna lie. This is going to make website creation so much easier.

**What we've accomplished today**

A lot, to be fairly honest. The control panel mechanism (henceforth called the Scrubber) has been mostly finalized, and members from that group have migrated over to drive train.
Drive train has settled into a basic outline of 6 wheels involving Colson wheels. For now, I think the drive train will contain all Colson wheels, though traction wheels could be added if the Colson wheels don't entirely work.
Jekyll has been set up. Obviously. Otherwise this site wouldn't exist. CSS is still *very* barebones, but the basic structure should be set up correctly.

**What we want to accomplish next time**

Alright, that's it. Regular posts will happen once coding really gets into full-swing.
