I"N<p>The first week of build season is coming to a close. Due to weather related incidents, tomorrow will be a shortened build day, going from 10:00 to 5:00 instead of from 10:00 to 10:00. However, many things are planned for tomorrow and, combined with what we have done in these three days, the coding team is off to a good start</p>
