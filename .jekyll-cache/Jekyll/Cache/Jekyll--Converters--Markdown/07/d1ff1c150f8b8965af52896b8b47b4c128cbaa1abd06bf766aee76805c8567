I"<p>Post one is live. Jekyll is an absolute godsend, not gonna lie. This is going to make website creation so much easier.</p>

<p><strong>What we’ve accomplished today</strong></p>

<p>A lot, to be fairly honest. The control panel mechanism (henceforth called the Scrubber) has been mostly finalized, and members from that group have migrated over to drive train.</p>

<p>Drive train has settled into a basic outline of 6 wheels involving Colson wheels. For now, I think the drive train will contain all Colson wheels, though traction wheels could be added if the Colson wheels don’t entirely work.</p>

<p>Jekyll has been set up. Obviously. Otherwise this site wouldn’t exist. CSS is still <em>very</em> barebones, but the basic structure should be set up correctly.</p>

<p>The robot project has been created. Yuri began coding the drive train, which is just normal tank. For now we’ll assume that it’ll be two motors on each side.</p>

<p><strong>What we want to accomplish next time</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish Jekyll Framework</li>
  <li>Get a bit further on Drive Train coding</li>
  <li>Learn PID</li>
  <li>Begin familiarizing everyone with WPILib 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, that’s it. Regular posts will happen once coding really gets into full-swing.</p>
