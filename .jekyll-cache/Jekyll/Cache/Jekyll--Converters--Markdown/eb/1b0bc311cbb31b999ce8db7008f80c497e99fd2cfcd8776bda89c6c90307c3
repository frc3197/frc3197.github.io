I"¢<p>Post one is live. Jekyll is an absolute godsend, not gonna lie. This is going to make website creation so much easier.</p>

<p><strong>What weâ€™ve accomplished today</strong>
A lot, to be fairly honest. The control panel mechanism (henceforth called the Scrubber) has been mostly finalized, and members from that group have migrated over to drive train.
Drive train has settled into a basic outline of 6 wheels involving Colson wheels. For now, I think the drive train will contain all Colson wheels, though traction wheels could be added if the Colson wheels donâ€™t entirely work.
Jekyll has been set up. Obviously. Otherwise this site wouldnâ€™t exist. CSS is still <em>very</em> barebones, but the basic structure should be set up correctly.</p>

<p><strong>What we want to accomplish next time</strong></p>

<p>Alright, thatâ€™s it. Regular posts will happen once coding really gets into full-swing.
