I"Å<p>I‚Äôve been sick for a while so the posts have been sparse, but I‚Äôm back and there‚Äôs a lot of progress and a lot of problems.</p>

<p><strong>What we accomplished these past 2 weeks</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Did Rudimentary Velocity Control</li>
  <li>Did some PID for turning, driving a certain distance, etc.</li>
  <li>Began doing Limelight</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What we are planning to do tomorrow</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Figure out why the output of the TrackLimelightX PIDCommand is 0. WHY IS IT 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah this problem annoys the heck out of me. Also there were a few naming problems and general version management that ended up deleting some old stuff and resulted in 6 different branches. 6 BRANCHES. WHAT HAPPENED.
What did, in fact, happen, is that I wasn‚Äôt there and organization kind of died. I‚Äôll be sure to clean up organization so that things are neater.</p>
